### Show Your Project - A Platform to Share Your Creativity with the Community

#### Introduction
Welcome to Show Your Project – a platform where you can showcase your projects, whether they are web applications, graphic designs, or other creative works. Our goal is to provide a space where you can share your ideas, connect with others, and receive feedback on your work.

You can not only post and describe your projects, but also share messages and thoughts with the community. Each post includes the ability to receive likes, views, and comments. Additionally, you can interact with others by liking their posts and projects, and you can track the number of views each one receives. The platform ensures a dynamic interaction between users by enabling full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts.
#### Key Features

- **User Profiles: Users can create and manage their own profiles to track their projects and interactions.

- **Post & Project Sharing: Share your work with the community and receive feedback through likes and views.

- **Likes & Views Count: Every post and project displays the number of likes and views to highlight user engagement.

- **Filtering & Pagination: Easily browse through projects with powerful filtering options and pagination for improved user experience.

- **CRUD Operations: Full control over your posts – you can create, edit, and delete your posts and projects.

- **Responsive Design: The platform is designed with a responsive layout to ensure seamless user experience on any device.

- **Secure User Management: We use Clerk for secure user authentication and account management.

#### Development Process
This platform was developed using a variety of modern technologies, including Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, TypeScript for type safety, TailwindCSS for styling, Node.js and Express for the backend, and Sequelize as the ORM connected to a PostgreSQL database.

Our development process emphasizes clean, maintainable code and an intuitive UI to deliver a seamless user experience.

#### Conclusion
"Show Your Project" isn't just a place to post your work – it's a community for creators to share, collaborate, and grow together. Whether you're an experienced developer, a designer, or a hobbyist, this platform offers the perfect space to connect with like-minded people and showcase your projects.
